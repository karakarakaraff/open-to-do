# Open To-Do API

Open To Do is an externally usable API for a basic to-do list application. This API will allow users to modify user accounts and to-do items from the command line.

## User stories in progress:

* As the API, I want to return JSON representations of users, lists and items
* As a user, I want to authenticate myself from the command line using a username and password
* As a user, I want to create new users, lists and items from the command line
* As a user, I want to remove users and lists from the command line
* As a user, I want to update list and item attributes from the command line
